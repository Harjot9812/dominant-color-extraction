# Dominant Color Extraction for Image Segmentation

 Image Segmentation
 * Segmentation partitions an image into regions having similar visual appearance corresponding to parts of objects
 * We will try to extract the most dominant 'K' Colors using K-Means
 * We can apply K-Means with each pixel will reassigned to the closest of the K Colors, leading to segmentation
